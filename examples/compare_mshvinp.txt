Both take the argument (std::istream &in)

Common variables:
  unsigned int n_vertices;                                                                            
  unsigned int n_cells;                                                                               
  unsigned int dummy;
  std::map<int, int> vertex_indices;                                                                       


gmsh:
determine file format
deals with physical entities


ucd:
read number of vertices and cells



Node comparison:
vertex_indicies
vertices
No obvious differences


Element/Cell comparison:
 both: cell_type, material_id,


MSH assigned the material_id based on the tag entity map, where UCD assigns directly from the file


UCD if 1. Dimension matches feature (i.e. 1D line, 2D quad, 3D hex)
       2. Line in 2D or 3D space
       3. Quad in 3D space

for 3D hex:
    check material_id is valid
    in >> cells.back().vertices[GeometryInfo<dim>::ucd_to_deal[i]];


MSH:
	cell type is specified within the .msh file:
	1=line, 2=tri, 3=quad, 4=tet, 5=hex
	in >> cells.back().vertices[GeometryInfo<dim>::ucd_to_deal[i]];
