Goals


define a point based on x,y,z coordinates
define dofs
define magnitudes

loop over cells
loop over cell vertices
check if vertex is sufficiently close to a BC point
look-up relevant dofs
look-up magnitudes
Apply constraint to each specified DOF
continue looping



user to supply node number? or coordinates?
Pull coordinates from mesh based on node number, assuming '.inp' style mesh


Investigate if there is a global array of vertices that can be accessed.  No, per Wolfgang
Look at vector distance calculation.


Read from general csv, but work for *.inp also.
New function [can be called by abaqus reader]



Efficiency considerations



parse in vector of unapplied boundary conditions [node #, x, y, z, u1, u2, u3]
or
parse in 2 vectors.  One of points, one of magnitudes
create empty vector of applied BCs

Scan cells, vertices
when found, apply BCs
move BC from unapplied to applied vector
